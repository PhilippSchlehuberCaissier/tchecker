   enroll(). A specialized version of enroll() for tchecker::pool_t adds the
   pool_t::collect() method to the list of functions. Enrolled functions should
   terminate. The GC is run in a separate thread. Hence, enrolled functions should
   be thread safe.
   \note Use enroll() to register functions and pools. Then, use start() to start
   garbage collecting, and stop_and_join() to stop garbarge collecting. Stop garbage
   collecting before any enrolled pool is destructed or freed.
